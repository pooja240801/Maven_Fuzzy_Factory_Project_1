CASE STUDY

Maven Fuzzy Factory has been operational for approximately 8 months. The company's CEO is due to present company performance metrics to the board next week. The task is to prepare relevant metrics to show the company’s promising growth.

Objective 

To extract and analyze website traffic and performance data from the Maven Fuzzy Factory database to quantify the company’s growth, and to tell the story of how the growth has been generated.
The first part is about extracting and analyzing the data, and then effectively communicating the story to the company's stakeholders. Focus is to tell the story of the company’s growth using trended performance data. Using the database (enclosed in create_mavenfuzzyfactory.zip) to explain some of the details around the company's growth story, and quantifying the revenue impact of some of the wins. The second part is about analyzing current performance and using that data available to assess future opportunities.
The project workflow follows the below key questions the CEO needs to be answered:

1.	Gsearch seems to be the biggest driver of our business. Could you pull monthly trends for gsearch sessions and orders so that we can showcase the growth there?
2.	Next, it would be great to see a similar monthly trend for Gsearch, but this time splitting out nonbrand and brand campaigns separately. I am wondering if brand is picking up at all. If so, this is a good story to tell.
3.	While we’re on Gsearch, could you dive into nonbrand, and pull monthly sessions and orders split by device type? I want to flex our analytical muscles a little and show the board we really know our traffic sources.
4.	I’m worried that one of our more pessimistic board members may be concerned about the large % of traffic from Gsearch. Can you pull monthly trends for Gsearch, alongside monthly trends for each of our other channels?
5.	I’d like to tell the story of our website performance improvements over the course of the first 8 months. Could you pull session to order conversion rates, by month?
6.	For the gsearch lander test, please estimate the revenue that test earned us.
7.	For the landing page test you analyzed previously, it would be great to show a full conversion funnel from each of the two pages to orders. You can use the same time period you analyzed last time (Jun 19 – Jul 28).
8.	I’d love for you to quantify the impact of our billing test, as well. Please analyze the lift generated from the test (Sep 10 – Nov 10), in terms of revenue per billing page session, and then pull the number of billing page sessions approximately 25:17 for the past month to understand monthly impact.
